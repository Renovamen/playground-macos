# About Me

## Biography

Hey there! I am a PhD student at the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.eecs.psu.edu/) department of [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/). Previously, I received my master's degree in [Computer Science](https://www.bu.edu/cs/) at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/) and bachelor's degree in [Software Engineering](http://sse.tongji.edu.cn/) at [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/).

I'm trying to find a balance between research and engineering.

My current research interests lie primarily in understanding and improving continuity, generalizability, efficiency and other key properties of machine learning. I am also interested in vision-language and video models.

I'm also learning web development and building machine learning softwares and systems.
