# About Me

## Biography

Hey there! I am a PhD student at the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.eecs.psu.edu/) department of [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/). Previously, I received my master's degree in [Computer Science](https://www.bu.edu/cs/) from [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/) and my bachelor’s degree in [Software Engineering](http://sse.tongji.edu.cn/) from [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/).

I'm trying to find a balance between research and engineering.

My current research interests primarily focus on understanding and enhancing the continuity, generalizability, efficiency, and other key properties of machine learning. I am also interested in large multimodal models.

I'm also learning web development and building machine learning software and systems.
